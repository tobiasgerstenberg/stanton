Dear friends, colleagues, and mailing list aficionados,

I’m writing to announce the official Call for Nominations for the 2024 Stanton Prize, administered by the Society for Philosophy and Psychology.

The Stanton Prize is awarded annually to an early-career scholar who has made significant contributions to interdisciplinary research in philosophy, psychology, or related disciplines, and who has been active in the SPP. Winners are chosen by the executive committee of the SPP. The Stanton award is endowed in honor of Harry and Betty Stanton of Bradford Books/MIT Press.

Tradition holds that we (roughly) alternate between giving the award to a philosopher and a psychologist. Winners are awarded $500, and deliver an award address at the annual SPP conference. The 2024 meeting will be held June 19-22 at Purdue University.

Nominations will be accepted until midnight (EST) on February 18, 2024, and should be sent by email to me at: eric.mandelbaum@baruch.cuny.edu (I’ll acknowledge receipt of each nomination. If you didn't get an acknowledgement within a week, please email me again.). Email subject line should begin “Stanton Prize Nomination.”

A complete nomination must include:

(A) From the Nominator
An email from an SPP member in good standing nominating the candidate, including the full names of the candidate and of the nominator. If the nominator prefers to remain anonymous, this may be specified in the nomination email, in which case the prize coordinator will contact the candidate to request the items in (B). Anonymous nominators should still provide (C) (just in case the candidate doesn’t).

(B) From the Candidate
An email stating (i) that they wish to be considered for the prize, (ii) that the nominating statement is accurate, and (iii) that they commit to attend this year's meeting and give a talk if they are awarded the prize. The candidate's full, current CV should be attached as a separate file.

(C) From either the Nominator or the Candidate
A brief statement of no more than 300 words describing: (i) the contributions of the candidate to interdisciplinary research in philosophy, psychology, or related disciplines, (ii) the career stage of the candidate, and (iii) the candidate's past participation in the SPP.

Eligibility
Anyone who has been active in SPP, and who conducts research in psychology, philosophy, and/or a related discipline, may be nominated. Career stage will also be considered in the decision, with a preference for researchers early in their careers. Members of the SPP executive committee are eligible to be nominated; any executive committee member who chooses to accept a nomination will not participate in the award decision.

Process
All complete nominations received by the deadline will be submitted to the executive committee of SPP. The winner will be chosen by vote.
